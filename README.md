# To-Do_List_Web-app
In this Project of the To-Do List Web-App, I have basically built a widespread and natural-looking web view page of the To-Do List web app. For this particular project, I especially used HTML, CSS, and JS. A To-do list is a list of tasks an individual needs to complete or accomplish. And user can easily add his/their tasks are typically put in order by priority or importance.
